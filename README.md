# TOP-admin-dash
Admin Dashboard project for The Odin Project.

No framework used again, Vanilla CSS (possible could change down the line)
Mostly used for learning grid.

NOTE: This Dash does not scale very well with overflow and different sizes. I will and have attempted to fix it where I can, but in the future, use flexbox instead of grid when working with variable sizes.
